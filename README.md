### Acknowledgments
We thank QuantaLab-IAS-CSIC staff members A. Vera, D. Notario, and R. Romero for laboratory assistance, and M. Morelli, L. Susca, G. Leon, J.L. Trapero-Casas, and D. Sacristán for their strong support during the field campaigns. We are also grateful for the information provided by the Plant Health Service of the Regional Ministry of Agriculture of the region of Valencia (Spain) on the phytosanitary status of almond orchards in the affected area of Alicante, and to TRAGSATEC (Grupo TRAGSA) for their support during the field campaign in Alicante. The study was partially funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through grant agreements POnTE (635646) and XF-ACTORS (727987), as well as by projects E-RTA2017-00004-02 from ‘Programa Estatal de I+D+I Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad’ of Spain and FEDER, Intramural Project 201840E111 from CSIC, and Project ITS2017-095 Consejeria de Medio Ambiente, Agricultura y Pesca de las Islas Baleares, Spain.
